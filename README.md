# AWS Infrastructure with Terraform: Full Documentation

# :blue_book: Overview

This repository provisions a complete AWS infrastructure using Terraform. It is designed for deploying a secure and scalable Kubernetes platform with GitOps using ArgoCD. The stack includes EKS, VPC, IAM roles, service accounts, load balancing and secret management.

# :wrench: Key Features:

- **AWS EKS**: Managed Kubernetes cluster with two auto-scaling node groups.
- **AWS VPC**: The networking environment where our EKS cluster run. Public and Private subnets, NAT Gateway for Private subnets.
- **AWS IAM Roles**: The Roles + policies which are needed for service accounts to access different AWS resources. (S3 for example)
- **AWS Secret Manager**: For storing and fetching secrets securely for our infrastructure/service accounts.
- **ALB**: Deploys ALB Controller in our EKS.
- **SA**: Service Accounts + needed roles and policies which they need to perform certain actions.
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps CD tool which streamlines the process of deploying applications on our cluster.
